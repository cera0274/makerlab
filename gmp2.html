    <h2>Summary</h2>

</div>

    <p>
      Our GMP2 project focused on creating a communication device for patients who
      are unable to speak, such as those who are intubated, sedated, or recovering
      from surgery. We developed a simple system using an Arduino, LEDs, and basic
      button inputs to allow patients to express emotions, needs, or discomfort using colour.
      My work in the group was focused on shaping the project’s concept, writing, and
      presentation. While the device was technically simple, its purpose was rooted in
      empathy to enable clear, low-effort communication in situations where
      misunderstanding can create stress or risk. The prototype highlighted how small,
      thoughtful interventions can support dignity and autonomy in healthcare settings.

    <h2>Design Problem</h2>

    <div class="image-slot"><img src="download.jpg"
     style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:12px; display:block;">
</div>

    <p>
      Nonverbal patients experience major communication barriers that can affect
      their comfort, care, and emotional well-being. Existing tools are often complex,
      require mobility, or expensive. Our challenge was to design
      something intuitive, gentle, and inexpensive; something that required almost no
      physical effort and could be understood at a glance by caregivers. We chose LED
      lights as our communication medium because they are responsive, emotionally expressive, and widely available. The underlying problem became designing a tool
      that balanced clarity, accessibility, and technological simplicity within  a hospital environment.

  <!-- DESIGN PROCESS -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>Design Process</h2>

    <div class="image-slot"><img src="beingbuilt2.png"
     style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:12px; display:block;">
</div>

    <p>
      We began by identifying gaps in hospital communication and discussing how
      patients often (literally) lack a voice during vulnerable moments. Early
      brainstorming explored gesture-based tools and using speakers, but we ultimately chose LEDs because they are simple, expressive, and
      require minimal physical effort and range of motion. While the technical members of the group wired
      and programmed the Arduino, I contributed through conceptual framing, design, and interpretation testing.
    </p>

    <p>
      The building process was mostly smooth with some difficulties. The team encountered wiring issues and had to learn (on the spot) many of the skills needed for this project. These challenges
      actually reinforced Ratto’s definition of critical making that prototypes are not meant
      to be polished, fully refined products, but tools that help us think through messy social and
      technical questions. Wark’s critique of maker culture also became relevant; that our
      “simple” device still relied on manufactured components, hidden labour, and
      broader sociotechnical systems. Throughout the process, we returned to our
      central question: does this device communicate in a way that is clear, ethical,
      and supportive of patient dignity?

  <!-- EVALUATION -->

    <h2>Evaluation</h2>

    <div class="image-slot"><img src="happy.png"
     style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:12px; display:block;">
</div>

    <p>
      Although technically minimal, our communicator prototype successfully opened
      conversation about patient autonomy and accessibility. During the Show & Tell
      session, viewers asked thoughtful questions about colour interpretation,
      cultural differences, staff training, and how the device could fit into real clinical
      settings. These responses showed that the concept resonated beyond the
      presentation. The project deepened my understanding of how socially responsible
      design and critical making intersect, as well as how even unfinished prototypes can
      reveal meaningful insights. Overall, GMP2 helped me grow as a designer by
      strengthening my empathy, communication thinking, and ability to connect
      technical constraints with human needs.
