    <h2>Summary</h2>

</div>

    <p>
      Our GMP1 project explored how a simple object like a box could be reimagined to address
      overlooked needs within homeless and low-income communities. We designed a soft,
      fabric-based hygiene and comfort pack inspired by an unfolded box layout. The pack stores
      menstrual and self-care items, includes hidden pockets for privacy, and unfolds into a small
      pillow that provides comfort for rest. By challenging the traditional idea of a rigid box,
      our project emphasized dignity, security, and mobility for vulnerable users. The prototype
      also highlighted how material choices and emotional considerations can shape meaningful,
      socially responsible design.

  <!-- DESIGN PROBLEM -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>Design Problem</h2>

    <div class="image-slot"><img src="sketch1.png"
     style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:12px; display:block;">
</div>

    <p>
      Homeless and low-income women often lack reliable access to menstrual products,
      self-care items, and any form of comfort during day-to-day life. Existing support systems
      prioritize food and shelter while overlooking hygiene and emotional needs that affect
      confidence, well-being, and physical health. Our challenge was to design an object that
      addressed both practical and emotional dimensions of care. We needed a solution that was
      portable, discreet, and user-friendly, while offering storage, comfort, and flexibility. The
      deeper problem became understanding how everyday objects could support dignity rather
      than simply provide function.

  <!-- DESIGN PROCESS -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>Design Process</h2>

    <div class="image-slot"><img src="beingbuilt1.png"
     style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:12px; display:block;">
</div>

    <p>
      Our design process began by grounding ourselves in the social realities of menstrual
      insecurity and homelessness. We analyzed how a box could be reframed as a system rather
      than a container, leading us to explore soft, foldable materials. From there, we sketched
      layouts based on an unfolded box net and translated them into fabric prototypes. One of our
      biggest challenges was technical: none of us knew how to sew, so we learned basic sewing
      techniques while constructing the prototype. Installing metal rods for structure proved
      physically demanding, and designing interior pockets required balancing storage capacity
      with portability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Iteration was central to the project. Every time we realized that a certain pocket would too bulky or a strap wouldn't
      hold, we returned to quick sketches and brainstorming ways to alter our prototype without compromising on the vision, which was a process that reflected McGlashan’s
      idea of “asking questions of the artifact.” Sustainability also shaped our decisions. We
      sourced second-hand dresses, reclaimed stuffing, and reused materials to keep the design
      affordable and environmentally responsible. Throughout the process, Ratto’s concept of
      critical making guided our mindset that the prototype didn’t need to be perfect, but it needed to
      help us think deeply about how design can respond to lived experience.

    <h2>Evaluation</h2>

    <div class="image-slot"> <img src="unfolded.png"
     style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:12px; display:block;">
    </div>

    <p>
      Our final prototype demonstrated how reframing a familiar form can create new meaning and purpose.
      The hygiene and comfort pack challenged assumptions about what vulnerable populations
      need by valuing emotional well-being as much as practicality. Audience feedback during our
      presentation highlighted interest in the pack’s portability, comfort features, and potential for
      customization through community workshops. While the build was imperfect, the project
      successfully merged social awareness with hands-on experimentation. Ultimately, GMP1
      strengthened my understanding of critical making, sustainability, and human-centered
      design as interconnected practices.
